    .sub_title What's the challenge?
    %p Refugees often live in displacement for decades. Therefore, it is critical to enable them to become economically independent and build a life on their own in a way that benefits both the refugees and their hosting communities – who also often face substantial problems.
    =render partial: "cta_buttons"

    %p ***stay up to date buttons
  .half
    .sub_title What‘s the opportunity?
    %p There is a huge untapped potential to create shared business opportunities for refugees and host communities.
    %p Think of shared workshops and joint creation of new services or products – doing business with each other provides an opportunity to meet, reduce prejudices and improve one’s livelihood.
    %p In Rwanda, our example-country for the Call for Solutions, refugees enjoy freedom of movement and have the right to work and establish companies. The Government of Rwanda and UNHCR are in the process of implementing a joint strategy for furthering economic development in host communities through refugee self-reliance.
    %p.bold So how can we create more shared business opportunities between both communities?

    %p Do you work with refugees and host community members to connect them through shared economic opportunities, but lack the resources to scale your approach globally?

    %p Do you have a solution in the private or non-profit sector that connects refugees and host community members through shared business opportunities and would like to share it?

    %p GIZ provides you with the opportunity to work with our network of development experts, designers, and entrepreneurs to scale up your solution and help your solution to have greater impact. Submit your solution until October 31st, 2018 and get the chance to participate in an Innovation Lab in Rwanda and prototype your solution together with the local refugee and host community.

    %p.bold.low_margin Instead of starting from scratch, we want to build on existing knowledge and experience
    %p We believe that there are people who have solved this challenge before us. Maybe in a different context, maybe with a different focus. None the less, we want to build on these experiences to leapfrog ahead to solutions that we know have the potential to make a change.

    %p.bold.low_margin Believing in the skills of others 
    %p As GIZ, we believe that everyone can bring something to the table, and that an intensive exchange of ideas is crucial for innovation. Hence, we appeal to all types of actors - large or small, NGOs, businesses or private individuals - to participate in our open Call for Solutions.
  .half
    %p.bold.low_margin Adapting the solutions to align with needs of local communities
    %p A jury will select the three solutions with the biggest potential, to be adapted to align with the needs of local communities. This adaption process will take place during the on-site Innovation Lab and prototyping phase. Following this one-week lab, the local teams receive seed investment from GIZ and arrange a market test of the adapted solution.
    %p As a pilot country, we chose Rwanda. However, the objective is to scale successful solutions in other countries facing similar challenges.

    %p.bold.low_margin Going Global
    %p Once the solution has been tested on the market, GIZ will support a global upscaling.

          At the beginning of 2018, Rwanda took in around 165,000 refugees, mainly from the DR Congo and Burundi. Almost all refugees speak the same as the locals - Kinyarwanda. Around 80% of refugees in Rwanda live in refugee camps. The country is also receiving Rwandan nationals who are returning home after years spent living abroad as refugees.

          Despite the strong economic growth of recent years, unemployment and under-employment present one of Rwanda’s greatest challenges. The majority of the people in the densely populated country work in agriculture where incomes are low. At the same time, the number of young people entering the labor market is constantly growing. Therefore, employment promotion is high on the national development agenda.

Initiated by UK’s Department of International Development (DFID), and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), the platform expands the access to customer markets and establishes a more stable economic situation and social cohabitation for the community members. To strengthen their business and entrepreneurial skills, DFID further introduced a “digital micro learning and community platform” offering a variety of course modules for the refugees and host communities. The platform content is accessible via smartphones, tablets or in the established learning centers.

          The pilot project “Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Energy in the Refugee Context in Uganda” provide refugees and host communities with market-based access to sustainable energy. It is funded by DFID and implemented by GIZ, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and Energising Development (EnDev) Uganda. As one part of the project, the energy kiosk - a shipping container with an attached brick storage room - will be solar powered and offers a range of various services and products. Among these are improved cook stoves, solar lanterns and home systems as well as energy services such as phone charging, printing, laminating, passport photos and internet access. While the kiosk in Rhino Camp Settlement will be run by a South Sudanese refugee youth group, the kiosk in Imvepi Settlement will be managed by a local NGO that employs host community members. Both kiosk manager groups will get technical trainings and additionally gain business skills such as bookkeeping, marketing and customer relation.

    %p.bold.red Participants can be private individuals, NGOs, foundations, associations, private enterprises and their employees as well as GIZ employees. We are hoping to receive a wide range of possible solutions.
    %p.bold.red In order to participate you need to:

    %p.bold.low_margin Submit a tested and implemented solution.
    %p We don’t want to reinvent the wheel, but build on existing knowledge and experience. Any solution that creates business opportunities for refugees and host communities can be submitted, as long as it has been tested and implemented elsewhere, no matter where and when.

    %p.bold.low_margin A solution that can be adapted and handed over.
    %p The solution does not need to be rooted in Rwanda, but should have the potential to be adapted to the local context.

  .half
    %p.bold.low_margin A solution that is benefitting refugees and host community members through shared business opportunities.
    %p We are looking for solutions that can create economic opportunities for both, refugees and host communities. There are no limitations on the kind of solutions: Your submission might be a product as well as a service, it might be a success story from another country in the region or from an entirely different continent. The sky is the limit! (I would delete this: or an adaptation from another context where it has proven effective.

    %p.bold.low_margin Be able to spend a week in Rwanda .
    %p Together, we will spend one week in Rwanda, where you can share your experience with locals from host and refugee communities. We will follow a design-led approach to develop rapid prototypes and seek feedback from local users.

    %p.bold.low_margin Fostering financial self-reliance 
    %p We are looking for solutions helping people to lead an independent life, and providing them with access to a regular income.

    %p.bold.low_margin Creating a benefit for refugee and host community
    %p We are looking for solutions that are not only focused on supporting refugees, but also provide a benefit to members of host communities and help strengthen the relationships between both groups.


  .half
    %p.bold.low_margin Enabling communities 
    %p The solutions must respond to people’s needs and should be implemented by refugees and host communities. We would love to see local people take ownership of the solutions instead of providing a service to them.

    %p.bold.low_margin Potential to scale 
    %p We picked Rwanda as a pilot country. Similar conditions in relation to refugees and host communities exist in other countries like Uganda, Tanzania or Iraq. We are looking for ideas that have the potential for scaling up, first in Rwanda, then beyond.


    %p.bold.low_margin Do no harm
    %p We are aware that any intervention could lead to results that are difficult to foresee. We are looking for solutions that are responsible and respectful towards locals and avoid negative impact.



#next.home_sec.container

    %h2 What happens next?
  .half
    %p.bold.red Your solution will be a first inspiration to refugees and host communities in Rwanda. If the prototype is successful, GIZ will support to scale the solution globally.

    %p.bold.low_margin Who owns the solution? 
    %p The submitted solution is yours, but by submitting it you are allowing us to develop it further and replicate it elsewhere. By sharing your knowledge and experience with host and refugee communities, you will inspire them to adapt the solution to their local context.

    %p.bold.low_margin What happens to your solution after the call?
    %p The moment you participate in the Innovation Lab, you will become a solution-mentor and work with the local members of the refugees and host community in a team. After the Innovation Lab, your team has the chance to pitch your enhanced solution to a jury for further investment.



  .half
    %p Your team can receive financial support from GIZ and its partners for running a 6-month long market-test, that is going to be conducted by the local part of your team and our design experts. But you can still support your team remotely during that market-test.

    %p GIZ will support an upscaling of the tested projects globally afterwards.


    %p.bold.low_margin How do refugees and host community members benefit? 
    %p Your experience and the support of GIZ will provide refugees and host communities with an opportunity to become financially independent.
    %p Forming a team and working on new business opportunities together, will bring great benefit to all participants and ensures, that your solution creates a real impact.

      /         %p.bold We are hoping to receive a wide range of possible solutions. In order to participate you need to:
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Submit a tested and implemented solution. 
      /         %p We don’t want to reinvent the wheel, but build on existing knowledge and experience. You can participate as an NGO, a private individual or a company – as long as your idea has been tested and implemented elsewhere.
      /         %p.bold.low_margin A solution that can be adapted and handed over. 
      /         %p The solution does not need to be rooted in Rwanda, but needs to have potential to be adapted to fit the local context. The objective is for locals to take ownership and continue adapting it.
      /       .half
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Be able to spend a week in Rwanda. 
      /         %p Together, we will spend one week in Rwanda, where you can share your experience with locals from host and refugee communities. We will follow a design-led approach to develop rapid prototypes and seek feedback from local users. Flight and accommodation will be payed for.

      /         %p.bold A jury – including members from GIZ, other leading organisations and possible users - will select the three best ideas. A good idea follows these principals:
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Do no harm 
      /         %p We are aware that any interventions could lead to results that are difficult to foresee. We are looking for solutions that are responsible and respectful towards locals and avoid negative impact.
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Fostering financial self reliance 
      /         %p We are looking for solutions that help people to lead an independent life providing them with the opportunity of a regular income.
      /       .half
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Creating a benefit for refugee and host
      /         %p We are looking for solutions that are not only focused on supporting refugees, but also provide a benefit to members of host communities and strengthen their relationships
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Enabling communities 
      /         %p The solutions need to respond to people’s needs and work in the local context. We would love to see local people take ownership of the solutions instead of providing a service to them.
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Potential to scale 
      /         %p We picked Rwanda as an example. Similar challenges exist in other countries like Jordan, Tanzania or Iraq. We are looking for ideas that have the potential to scale, first in Rwanda than beyond.

      /       .half
      /         %p.bold Your idea will be inspiration to refugee and host communities all over the world. If the prototype is successful, GIZ will support different communities to scale it globally in.
      /         %p.bold.low_margin Who owns the idea? 
      /         %p The idea is yours – of course. By sharing your knowledge and experience with host and refugee communities you will inspire them to adapt the solution to their local context.
      /       .half
      /         %p.bold.low_margin How do refugees profit? 
      /         %p Your experience and the support of GIZ will provide refugees and host communities an opportunity to become financially independent.
